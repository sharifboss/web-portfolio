        <h2>My Dream</h2>
        
        <h3>Making New Dream For New Era</h3>
        <p>As a novice web developer, I was excited to embark on my journey into the world of coding, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I remember my first attempts at building a simple webpage – the satisfaction of seeing elements come together and the frustration when things didn't work as expected. This experience taught me the importance of patience and perseverance in solving coding challenges.</p>

            <h3 class="name-highligth">2024-Present | World Pro Leader</h3>
            <p>Early in my career, I encountered a situation where a minor typo in my code caused a major layout issue on a client's website. This mistake taught me the importance of thorough code reviews and testing. It also made me more cautious about the impact of seemingly small errors and encouraged me to develop a meticulous eye for detail.</p>

            <p>Exploring front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js opened up a new world of possibilities for me. Learning to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces using these frameworks was both challenging and rewarding. I enjoyed the modularity and structure they brought to my projects, as well as the vibrant communities</p>
